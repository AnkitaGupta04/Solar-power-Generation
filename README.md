# Solar-power-Generation

# INTRODUCTION
Solar power is one of the most promising and fast-changing renewable energy sources, providing a clean alternative to fossil fuels and a critical tool for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. As the future of energy is going green, solar power has been welcomed with a massive amount of momentum because of its ubiquity, scalability, and reducing cost of photovoltaic technology. However, the efficiency and dependability of solar power generation are extremely sensitive to a plethora of dynamic parameters such as weather (e.g., solar irradiance, temperature, and humidity), performance profile of the solar panel, and external environmental factors such as dust deposition or equipment degradation. These parameters combined affect the energy yield from the sun, therefore the importance of understanding fully their interdependence in maximizing output and ensuring system longevity.

# OBJECTIVES
1.	For Analysis of the Relationship Between Weather Parameters and Power Generation: The primary objective is to investigate how weather factors—e.g., solar irradiation, ambient temperature, module temperature, and potentially other factors such as humidity or wind speed—affect the energy output of solar panels. 
2.	To Identify Trends and Seasonal Patterns in Power Generation Data: This objective is about identifying long-term patterns (e.g., general increases or decreases in generation capacity due to panel aging or technology improvement) and short-term seasonal patterns (e.g., daily patterns depending on sun hours or monthly variations due to seasonal weather variations) in the solar power generation data. 
3.	 Model for Power Generation Prediction: The essence of this project lies in the development of a precise and reliable forecasting model to forecast future power generation based on historical data. This objective involves the development and tuning of various time-series models—ARIMA, SARIMA, machine learning approaches (e.g., XGBoost), deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).
4.	To Detect Anomalies Which Could Be Associated with Defective Equipment or Needs Maintenance: This is to identify abnormal behaviour or outliers in the power generation data that may be a predictor of equipment faults, inefficiencies, or maintenance requirements.
